# Welcome to my avdent of code answers

This is a reop where I will be storing all of my advend of code answers as well as the inputs I was given

## File structure

The file structure will be as followed in what ever language you choose to work with.

- Day:
    * Part 1
    * Part 2
    * Input

If you do not manage to finsish a part still upload it you can always come back another time and try and solve it or even see how you have progressed as a programmmer!

## finally!

Make it public! once the calendar is finished make it public it would be awesome to compare solutions and see solutions other languages!

Have Fun!
